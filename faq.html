                over
                to get a keepsake copy of the yearbook made for you. We will have the yearbook designed afterwards
                by a
                company, so we aren't sure how much it will cost per copy yet!</p>

                airplanes
                to see who's can fly the farthest (A photo will be taken to commemorate the event too).</p>

                will be tied together by a ceremonial rope.</p>
            <p>The Unfasting Ceremony will be a much shorter small ceremony where the rope is removed, signifying

                (just
